The sustainable development of a nation depends on its ability to integrate scientific advances to address contemporary challenges.
In Benin, these challenges are numerous and interconnected: emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, the spread of zoonotic diseases, the rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance, and increased exposure to environmental pollutants — including contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as microplastics, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, and persistent chemicals. Exacerbated by the effects of climate change, these threats pose major risks to human health and ecosystems. Meeting these challenges requires adapted, inclusive, and evidence-based solutions, especially to protect the most vulnerable communities.

The Research Center for Global Health Action on Climate Change, Gender Equity, and Emerging Diseases (CHANGE) was created to address these pressing issues. CHANGE is a non-political, non-profit organization committed to transforming scientific knowledge into concrete and sustainable actions.

CHANGE focuses its work on seven main areas:

Combat emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance: Identify, monitor, and fight these major health threats using advanced genomic tools to trace pathogen evolution and better understand transmission networks. CHANGE also promotes innovative solutions, such as bacteriophage use and other credible alternatives to antibiotics, to address antimicrobial resistance and preserve treatment effectiveness.

Reduce the impacts of environmental pollutants: Monitor and mitigate the effects of environmental pollutants, including contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), to protect public health and preserve ecosystems.

Strengthen local capacity through tailored scientific actions: Develop early warning systems, train local actors, and promote preventive strategies to anticipate and manage health and environmental crises.

Ensure gender equity and social inclusion: Integrate these principles into all of the organization’s activities, with particular emphasis on the active participation of women, children, and marginalized groups.

Promote climate adaptation and resilience: Support vulnerable communities in risk assessment and the implementation of sustainable solutions to address climate change impacts.

Value and disseminate scientific discoveries.

Transform research results into practical, accessible tools for communities, decision-makers, and partners. By making scientific innovations understandable and actionable, CHANGE maximizes their impact on sustainable development and community resilience.

In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — notably SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) — CHANGE is committed to catalyzing positive and inclusive transformations to strengthen population resilience and ensure a better future.
